This CLI-based game was created by Yaboku Games and can be played by anyone.
The program itself works as the game engine, and will soley be used by the DM.
The other players can view their character sheets by using a Google Sheet.
The program can automatically update these sheets if you create a 
google service account and link it in the google_sheet.py module.
